Hello, in this maven project, I have implemented a library system for IIITD library system can be used very efficiently by providing valid inputs into the program.
It also calculates fines as the information provided by the pdf of assignment. It has many features like adding book, removing book, adding member, removing member, issuing a book, paying fine, returning book with balancing, etc.

The code works fine with Maven, I have also updated the pom.xml file

Procedures To run the code :-
0. open IntellijIdea Ide.
1. go to src\main\java\org\example\Main.java
2. then on right-side of your screen click on maven.
3. now click on clean
4. now click on package (i have updated [pom.xml] so it will not throw error).
5. a new folder named target will be made automatically.go to that folder and run (by right clicking) the .jar file.
6. it will run as per the guidelines with the same instruction sets.
7. there is error handling also.
8. you can also read to get the dependencies (junit v-3.8.1)that i have used.

Thank you. :-)
